                Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade 
                Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths.
                Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. 
                The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group,
                the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea"), and the most recent analyses suggest
                 it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea").
                Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.</p>

    <h2> Monkey</h2>

            <span>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes,
                also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted
                 as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based 
                 on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms
                  in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys
                   (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the 
                   broad sense, which again includes apes).</span>

    <h3>Tiger</h3>
    <div class ="row" >

            <div style="color:orange;">The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
                It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
                 An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial
                  and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which
                   support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother
                    for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish 
                    their own.</div>
